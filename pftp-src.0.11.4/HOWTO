this is a small example of how to use some features in pftp

make sure you read the readme file in directory old

1. transfering whole dir with subdirs
 - well just make sure you have FXP mode set, then just press 't' on the
   dir u want to upload..., you can also select more dirs, or files to
   transfer...

2. moving manually (both fxp and ftp mode)
 - press 'p' on the dir to get inside of it on both servers (if the dir isnt
   created yet on the destiny server, pftp will create it, then you should
   just press 'a' to compare the files, and then 't' to transfer them

3. using of exclude files/dirs...
 - go to site preferences (from bookmarks press 'm' or 'e', or if you are
   logged in press 'e' from filelist window) then using 'SPACE' check the
   exclude option, press 'ENTER' on it to edit the field...
   example of the field : "*missing* *.bad *incomplete* [*"
    
   exclude is used during dir transfers, filelist comparing, new dirs
   anouncing, etc...

4. read the README in 'old' directory, it is for older version, but you can
   learn from it how to use chain mode, what to edit in the config file, and
   lot more
   
5. stoping transfer
   at the moment you cant just stop transfer but you still can kill it
   by pressing 's' and then 'c' on the site...
   
6. contacting
   if you have any question or you miss something in pftp mail me to hoe@dle.sk
