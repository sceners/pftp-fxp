II@0.11.3 SEPTEMBER EDiTiON:
---------------------------
- FIX : should compile as static on fbsd now
- FIX : crash that happened rarely, usually during stealth mode dirlisting 
 (control buffer size +1 in tcp.h - for mew :P)
- CHANGE : increased networking buffer, should increase dl/up speed ? plz let me know about results
- NEW : new sorting algorithm, dirlist sorting is now MUCH faster, very usefull in big directories
 (tested with 8000+ directories in one dirlist, speed was before 5 seconds, now less than 1 sec)
- NEW : while changing directory the window with dirlist will be empty
- CHANGE : debug file will now be created only if you ./configure --debug and set DEBUG=1 in config
- CHANGE : during fxp files will now be transfered first, directories will recurse after files...
- NEW : during fxp pftp will try to mark and unmark files in dirlist with yellow color :P

II@0.11.2 AUGUST EDiTiON:
---------------------------
- FIX : you can set "jump to newest" in preferences again
- FIX : "random refresh/noop" is now saved properly
- FIX : fixed rare stealth mode dirlist filename damaging in filelist :)
- FIX : attempted to fix big ports problems for those who has them
  all works ok to me so please report if it helped etc to pftp forums
- NEW : stealth now works in no_lreply mode, its kinda hidden feature in
  glftpd and other ftpds, its turned on by logging in with "-" before your
  password "-password", and it will make the ftpd not to send so much
  messages to client, so it will speed up some things but you will loose
  lots of info from server... thanx for telling me this exists :) no idea
  how that got into glftpd (maybe standard wu-ftpd trick ?)
- FIX : again fixed name for Crashev, i hope its the last time now :)
- FIX : fixed idiotic bug that was causing "unable to create temp file" in
  win32 version, was caused by okay dir setting in .pftpconf which wasnt 
  absolute, and if you changed local directory it failed looking for "ok" directory
  now pftp will add currect directory to okay dir if its not absolute (starting with /)
  (many ppl reported this over the time and i wasnt able to reproduce it until i accidentally
  changed my local directory today :P)
- INFO : if you want to resize in the win32 version make sure you have window size and buffered
  size with same value (in the windows resize dialog), else the screen will be messed up (this
  is needed in w2k/xp, not tested on 9x/me)

II@0.11.1 SUMMER EDiTiON:
---------------------------
- FIX : cygwin build wasnt working
- CHANGE : rewritten networking system, should properly handle
  timeouts, network errors etc and should be FASTER! timeout is set to
  2 minutes, should be enuf and maybe too much ? but its nice in case of
  big lag
- FIX : pftp will now properly detect network failure for connections (i hope)
- FIX : pftp will now properly close opened connections so you wont run out
  of sockets... (again i hope)
- FIX : fixed stealth dirlist in some cases, thanx to b*** for having
  broken sitedir so i could test it :) (actually i had to rewrite whole networking
  to fix this :))

II@0.11.0 MEWTWO EDiTiON:
---------------------------
- INFO : new bookmarks again, pftp will attempt to autoconvert but
  make sure you add site ports to hostnames BEFORE upgrading to 0.11.0 
- INFO : make sure you try to turn on stealth mode on your sites,
  refreshing dirlist will be MUCH faster if the site deamon supports this
  (works on glftpd and other unix ftpds, doesnt work with raidenftpd etc)
  this feature help alot on tls site, there may be bugs in it so report
  problems to me please
- FIX : can be now compiled without ssl support again (by ms)
- FIX : makefiles reworked, report problems :)
- NEW : filesizes are now displayed in new nicer format (by ms)
- NEW : more filesizes changes, report bugs :)
- NEW : added distclean to makefile (by ms)
- CHANGE : to quit press 'Q' (shift-q), changed from 'q' so you wont quit
  by accident anymore
- CHANGE : some small color scheme changes
- FIX : 'k' upload (.ok file) works again without logging off the site
- ADD : partial merge with mew4, i didnt include his keyboard shortcut changes
  and new sections support, for me its a bit useless and ugly :)
   anyway this merge means :
  -removed PORT setting from config , you have to add it to hostname
 (hostname:port)  
  -not included LASTFILEFILTER, waiting for mew to add FIRSTFILEFILTER :) 
  -moved random refresh and stealth settings to per site preferences
  -added retry login ability with configurable pause and attempt count
  -dont ask about adding 'e' command from mew, i consider that autotrading
- NEW : inteligent TYPE setting (based on the mew idea)
- NEW : autoassign autologged sites to shortcut keys in pairs (-connect=s1,s2
  will put s1,s2 to shortcut key 1)
- FIX : after big memory audit i fixed couple of memleaks
     
II@0.10.1 WiNDOWS EDiTiON:
---------------------------
- FIX : fixed black borders with rh 7.3 ncurses
- FIX : fixed some cygwin problems (every thread has same pid in cygwin heh)
- FIX : small ssl fix causing problems in cygwin
 (thanx to everyone for reporting these problems)
- FIX : fixed name of crashev in changelog :)

II@0.10.0 AfteR EDiTiON:
---------------------------
- NEW : applied prefs patch by kot (adds some usefull settings for sites)
- NEW : did some cleanup in the patch + fixed some problems
- NEW : fixed problem with raiden ftpd causing pftp to crash when downloading
  mp3 files (problem reported and fixed by crashev) (i didnt test this myself)
- INFO : boomark file is now changed a bit, pftp will autotry to upgrade
  old bookmark file
- INFO : removed some useless settings from config file :)
  
II@0.9.10 BuSTeD EDiTiON:
---------------------------
beta1:
- FIX : crashfix with serverswitching (rare)
- NEW : pftp will now try to encrypt local transfers : dirlist, leeching...
  fxp crypting is not supported yet...
beta2:
- FIX : problem with passive encrypted connections
- FIX : crashfix when killing fxp sites
- NEW : shift-T in fxp mode will transfer selected and disconnect from the
  sites

II@0.9.9 BuSTeD EDiTiON:
---------------------------
- NEW : you can now scroll to left and right in view file window
- FIX : some FXP engine changes (if you get nuked during upload
  pftp should not create subdirs anymore...)
- NEW : !!! you can now abort fxp queue transfer by pressing 't' again
- NEW : added next/prev server switch, press '[' or ']'
- FIX : fixed cursor position in dialog input window
- CHANGE : many changes in resize handler, hopefully it wont break anything
- FIX : changed recv() calls to read() and pftp now again works in CYGWiN :)
  (there is some recv() bug with non-blocking sockets in cygwin...)
- FIX : pressing 'x' (site command) now works in fbsd, still dunno why
  it crashes when you resize terminal on fbsd and raana is even more
  lazy then me
- NEW : !!! you can now scroll cursor left/right in input window
- FIX : some more CYGWiN fixes, now it doesnt crash when you quit pftp
- CHANGE : changed CTRL-key jumping to ESC-key (in filelist and bookmarks)
- NEW : added support for HOME/END keys, works in filelist, bookmarks,  
  input line, file viewer etc
- NEW : (by sadman) new commandline parameter -connect=site1,site2,...
  will make pftp to autlogin to sites site1 and site2...
- NEW : added ability to disable TLS for some sites, you can do it in .pftpconf
  until i add it to bookmarks, just add line NOTLS=site1,site2...
- CHANGE : again changed keyhandler coz the pause for ESC-key combinations
  was too small, now if you want to just press ESC press it 2x or you
  will have to wait much longer for it to timeout, this gives you bigger
  chance to press a key after ESC for example for ESC-number combinations
- FIX (by sadman) : fixed typo in reverse fxp
- FIX : more cleanup in fxp code, removed ugly display-server memory problems
- FIX : lots and lots fixes in pthread canceling, finally threads behave nice
  in CYGWiN and also this possibly fixed issues in other platforms
- NEW : you can now scroll left/right in log too
- NEW : added logging messages to pftp.debug.log file, this will be usefull
  if pftp crashes, so i can check what was happening etc, plz if you get
  any segfaults send that file to me with info what was you doing etc
  this file is recreated each time you run pftp (the file will be in
  your okaydir so check the .pftpconf)
- NEW (by usurper and fixored by me): added some bnc support, to site host
  you can add "ip ip2:port ip3" normally default port is used, but if the
  bnc has different one you can specify it, note next ip is tried it connect()
  fails (BTW strtok() sux !!!!, strsep rox :))
beta 6:
- FIX : fixed crash with filename longer then 200 chars 
- CHANGE : coz some idiots added all their sites to NOTLS line in .pftpconf
  (even those that had no problems loggin in) i have decided to add a pause
  to NOTLS sites, so basically now its faster to let the site try to go in
  TLS mode....
- INFO : changelog for 0.9.9 is getting big :)
- FIX : fixed stupid bug when aborting fxp transfer from destination window  
- FIX : more fixes in resize handler, one day it will work properly
  if u manage to crash it plz mail me pftpdebuglog from your ok dir
  (looks like i am the only one getting resize crashes from time to time heh)
beta7:
- FIX : more resize fixes, i am really the only one who can make it crash
  and i still dunno how, and why :) anyway now signals are handled properly,
  only main thread is getting sigwinch signal, so lets hope this is the last
  time i am fixing terminal resize
- NEW : fixed CYGWIN codepage problems, all i had to do was to add 
  "set CYGWIN=codepage:oem", to runme.bat  
- NEW : added more debug info to some functions, you can turn on/off the debug
  output in the .pftpconf now (DEBUG=1/0)
beta8:
- FIX : i am tired of that resize crashing, i tried some more changes
  this time :)
- NEW : temp file creating changed as some ppl complained about cygwin
  version problems, i never had that problem heh, maybe its fixed now ?
    
II@0.9.8 HoE EDiTiON:
---------------------------
- NEW : added LOCALIP to .pftpconf, you can now either use DEVICE setting
  or LOCALIP setting
- NEW : added X-DUPE feature (glftpd 1.24+)
  (please note that X-DUPE feature is not automatically added by upgrading
  to glftpd 1.24+, you need to have xdupe line in glftpd.conf, plz refer
  to glftpd docs !)
- NEW : (by raana) added sorting by size
- NEW : (by raana) added files skipping in ftp mode
- NEW : timestamps to logs
- CHANGE : directories starting with '[' or '!'  are now after other dirs
- NEW : added DEFAULTFILTER to .pftpconf (its a global file ignore list)
- NEW : fixed random segf during fxp (added workaround for glftpd bug)
  and added some recovery checks for bad pasv replies, etc
  plz report any segfaults from now on, but i need to know how to reproduce
  the crashes or else ill not be able to fix it
- FIX : X-DUPE moved after login so custom x-dupe implementations can work
- CHANGE : fast server switching works now different way, you can assign
  a number 2 servers with ESC+<1-9> and then with the key <1-9> switch to
  these 2 server, for example you have server A in left window and B in right
  and you press ESC+1, later anytime you press 1 server A will come to left
  window and server B to right one (idea by Snail0r)
- FIX : attempted to fix some screen size change crashes
- FIX : xdupe is now case insesitive + fixed some bugs (+one memory leak)
- INFO : there will be no more public source from now on, this is because
  some ppl remove the password protection for userfile to log in the sites
  faster and because there are some patches for pftp that are not public
  (the author didnt mail be about those, read changelog for 0.9.5), anyway
  if you want to add some feature for pftp you can still mail me about it
  and i can send you the src, but i am pissed about ppl being so selfish to
  create private patches for opensourced pftp
- FIX : xdupe now works with color turned on in glftpd+fixed couple of color
  related problems (ansi stripping, etc) (bug found thanx to mcr)
- NEW : added filter for viewable characters in file viewing, viewing binary
  files and some weird .nfos made for example secure crt really confused
  this can be configured in .pftpconf, there are 2 methods : VIEWFILTER=0
  will filter all characters that are not printable (<32) and all 8-bit chars
  (use this method for ssh session with windows clients etc), VIEWFILTER=1  
  will only filter not printable chars (works nice on console)
  
II@0.9.7 HoE EDiTiON:
---------------------------
- NEW : (by Xinu) added passive mode to pftp, it is activated by default but
  can be turned off in .pftpconf by setting PASSIVE=0
  PASV mode is for file lists/uploads/downloads when you are behind a firewall
  or NAT
- CHANGE : (by whoey) files are now explicitly opened in binary mode, should
  fix some problems with the cygwin build
- NEW : by pressing 'shift-f' you can cycle back in dirlist formats
- NEW : in TLS mode sites that are connected in encrypted mode will show
   be labeled with *name
- NEW : 'h' is now a shortcut to "site undupe" and 'shift-h' to "site wipe -r"
- FIX : 'k' finally works in fxp, it trasfers files as file.ok.zip, and it is
   ignoring directories
- CHANGE : sorting is now case-insensitive
- CHANGE : (by ilasz) dirsizes are in human readable form now :)
   plz note that it depends on ftpd settings too, some ftpd show dirsizes
   in bytes, some in megabytes... so dont be confused if something goes wrong
   for servers set to show sizes in megabytes and bytes it should work ok
   for those that show size in kbytes it can get confusing with huge dirs
   like 1gb or bigger i think (i may add per site setting to pftp later)
- FIX : fixed fancy bug in kb/s report after fxp at midnight 
- NEW : fxp engine will now use absolute paths, so it will corretly follow
   symlinks back to the start, however your symlinks recurse pftp will end up
   in neverending loop
- NEW : shift-x sends the site command to all sites now
- NEW : you can now switch to window with no site or connecting site
- FIX : some fixes in fxp routines, but the main cleanup is still coming 

II@0.9.6 HoE EDiTiON:
---------------------------
- NEW : (by raana) added shortcut for nuke - j and unnuke - J (shift-j)
- CHANGE : the username and password field in ftp preferences is now longer
  so now it is possible to use proxy servers that use username or password
  for connection info
- NEW : the filelist formats has been changed, there are 4 now
   1. filename and size (if size of dir is supported by ftpd its showed)
   2. filename only
   3. filename, mode and date
   4. filename, user and group
 you can change them by pressing f in filelist
       
II@0.9.5 HoE EDiTiON:
---------------------------
- INFO : i had some free time today, so here is what i did this afternoon,
  enjoy... btw if anyone adds any feature or fix to pftp code he HAS TO 
  mail me the patch... if i find out that someone is using some modified
  pftp based on what i did, ill never release new version ! i think its
  really selfish from the coder...
- FIX : some cygwin port fixes (there isnt full pthreads support in cygwin)
- FIX : segfault if there was file longer then 100mb in filelist
- FIX/CHANGE : pftp now correctly binds to the device specified in config
  so you can use virtual devices etc... (DEVICE=eth0:1) (hey wardener :))
- FIX : fixed segf when doing pgdn while connecting to site and some more
  opensite related problems are fixed
- NEW : when fxping whole directories pftp automatically compare directories
  to skip dupes and 0-byte files
    
II@0.9.4 HoE EDiTiON:
---------------------------
- CHANGE : page-down jumping in filelist a bit changed
- FIX : small fix in switch servers
- NEW : compiles on FBSD4, and with tweaking on CYGWIN

II@0.9.3 HoE EDiTiON:
---------------------------
- FIX : another bug in sorting fixed, now the files from last year will be
 no more before new files when sorting by time

II@0.9.2 HoE EDiTiON:
---------------------------
- FIX : a nice Y2K bug was removed in the sortfilelist function :)

II@0.9.1 HoE EDiTiON:
---------------------------
- FIX : had to remove cursor jumping, it was caused black screen for some
 people...
- NEW : in filelist window you can now fast-switch servers with 1-9 keys

II@0.9.0 HoE EDiTiON:
---------------------------
- NEW : i made a handler for terminal size changes, it should not crash now
       (but if you make the window too small it will crash anyway)
- CHANGE : bookmark file changes, auto convert of old bookmarks...
 (just started changing the code, will be finsihed in next version
  i am going to add bouncers support, dirlist type per site, ssl option
  per site, maybe something else needed ? mail me)
- CHANGE : i made the cursor to jump on proper possition in dialog window
 (note : removed in 0.9.1, was causing problems)
- FIX : bookmark jumping fixed
- FIX : cleanup in the fxp routines, should be more stable
- FIX : some changes in the stealth mode, however i do not recommend to use it,
  coz it may still not work with some ftpds, and it is obsolete anyway...
  however this is the only way to use pftp for those who are behind firewalls
  until i make pftp support PASV listing !!! so if you need PASV dirlist just
  try stealth first, it may work perfectly for you (tested with glftpd)  
- FIX : fixed pthreads problem which caused pftp not work with systems
  with glibc 2.2.x (like rh7)
    
II@0.8@9 HoE EDiTiON:
---------------------------
- NEW : experimental SSL support for GLFTPD (not in public yet :))
 this is very experimental and also has no bookmark settings yet...
 you will only get it if you compile pftp using Makefile.tls...
 and you need openssl installed to compile it
- FIX : fixed segfault when pftp crashed in case one of servers in FXP
 timeouted

II@0.8@8 HoE EDiTiON:
---------------------------
- CHANGE : small keyhandler change, CTRL-Z is now ignored and also it allows
 me to handle CTRL-key pressing
- FIX : hopefully fixed the 'SEG AT GETFILELISTENTRY' crash when starting pftp
 (caused by pressing ENTER on welcome screen too much and fast :))
- NEW : 'CTRL-char' will move you to first entry starting with the char, if
 such entry doesnt exist it will jump to nearest entry with lower value, if
 you are already on entry starting with this char you will be moved to next,
 this works in bookmarks and in filelist windows (it may not work with
 few chars like CTRL-M or CTRL-H coz these are reserved, CTRL-M=ENTER and
 CTRL-H=BACKSPACE, but it still may work with some terminal settings)
 
II@0.8@7 HoE EDiTiON:
---------------------------
- FIX : fixed ftp4all issue with usernames longer than 8 chars
- FIX : some small display fixes related to FXP time displaying
- NEW : when switching to window that is in FXP mode then then in other window
 you automatically get the related FXP server
- NEW : when you kill a window in FXP mode the second server is killed too
- NEW : switch window position is automatically set to your current server
 
II@0.8@6 HoE EDiTiON:
---------------------------
- CHANGE : compare now does not mark 0-byte long files... but this does not
   mean that the 0-byte files are always skipped ! only in filelist compare 
- CHANGE : position for new window is now suggested as opposite from current
   window
- FIX : another anounce fix in fxp, this time dupe anounce
- CHANGE : finally i decided to fix the keyboard handler to some final
   state, now it should work very fine for most ppl, if you have some problem
   with it try this : 1. try playing with your TERM setting, something like
   vt220,vt300,linux or maybe vt120 should work fine, and also dont forget
   to set it in your client (in CRT or Secure CRT software i use CUSTOM
   setting and vt220-linux.key) and 2. try turning on NUMLOCK and the numeric
   pgup/down should work fine for you
- FIX : if u deleted a site the bookmarks were not saved by default.. fixed
- FIX : better fix for RETR fail problem in fxp... (last fix didnt fix the
   problem if last file could not be retrieved)
- NEW : there is no need to quit pftp to save bookmarks now, after closing
   bookmark window or preferences window bookmarks should be saved
- NEW : switch window now shows fxp transfers
- NEW : during fxp transfers you can now see the time on the top of window   

II@0.8@5 HoE EDiTiON:
---------------------------
- FIX : status line anounce after file upload in fxp is now fixed, it was
   showing site label of source site...
- CHANGE : again i rewrote some keyhandling so you can now use PGUP,PGDN and
   INS,DEL keys even with vt100 in screen :) its done using numbers as
   characters so you can do PGUP also by pressing "9" 
   
II@0.8@4 HoE EDiTiON:
---------------------------
- CHANGE : in case compare didnt find any file cursor is not moved to first
    entry in the filelist anymore..., in case anything is found, it is moved
    to first marked entry
- FIX : fixed fxp routine to stop consuming so much cpu time during transfer...
    sorry about this :)
    
II@0.8@3 HoE EDiTiON:
---------------------------
- CHANGE : keyhandler is now rewritten to handle escape keyboard sequences
   that ncurses does not handle, this makes user to be able to use PGUP and
   PGDN with crappy terminals, but from now on you have to press ESC always
   2x to make it work.

II@0.8@2 HoE EDiTiON:
---------------------------
- FIX :fixed bug in fxp routine causing transfer to hang if RETR failed

II@0.8@1 HoE EDiTiON:
---------------------------
- FIX : pftp crashed during transfer with auto-noop or auto-refresh on...FIXED

II@0.8@0 HoE EDiTiON:
---------------------------
- FIX : files "aaa.rar" and "aaa.rar-missing" are no more considered as same
  in filelist comparing (length is now compared too)
- NEW : whoa, finally u can check why u didnt log in, after each logout from
  server the log is now copied to localhost log, so you can view it by
  pressing l in localhost window...
- NEW : ctrl-u now deletes whole line in dialog input window (works at least
  on console, i didnt test it on other terminals yet) 
- CHANGE : changed version numbering so we can get to v1.0 a bit faster :)
- CHANGE : changed the gay packaging style-files are in dir
- NEW : added key shortcuts to bookmark window
- CHANGE : changed Makefile, do "make static" to create static binary
- FIX : if you view a file from remote ftp it will be deleted now after you
  close the view window...
- NEW : added setting in config file - LOCALDIR, pftp changes local filesystem
  dir to the specified dir at the start (feel free to comment it out if u dont
  need it
- FIX : you cannot transfer ".." anymore...
- NEW : fxp engine has been rewriten, it should be more stable then before,
  fxping dirs does not cause segfaults anymore, speed does not mess anymore,
  but there still may be some buggs i have made :) ill do some real testings
  and fix it in next version
  (now pftp in fxp mode works like flashfxp, with one queue for each 2 servers,
  so u will be able to edit/flush/stop the queue, after i make an editor :))
  (btw killing a source server will result in dead destination server, coz
  its in slave mode (urgent mode), u will need to kill it too)
- WARNING : NEVER USE FXP FOR DIRS WITH LINKS !!!!!!!!
  pftp will follow the link and will create nice recursive mirror...
  (a link to /archive/ will make a nice mess with your credits :))
    
II@0.7.3.2@0 HoE EDiTiON:
---------------------------
- small fix in closing notice dialog if the password to run pftp was bad
- one really stupid bug in SortFilelist() fixed, no more crashing and
  missing files hopefully
- changed makefiles to use g++ (no idea why there was gcc until now)
  
II@0.7.3.1@0 HoE EDiTiON:
---------------------------
- hm the feature of moving cursor to upper left corner had to be disabled :(
  refresh() is causing black screen if anyone knows how to do this plz let
  me know

II@0.7.3@0 HoE EDiTiON:
---------------------------
- if cursor is not hidden it is now moved to upper corner
- i have finally figured out that ncurses support panels, so the screen
  problems should now be fixored
- bugfixed filter function (fixed by sadman)
- new filter defaults are : "*nuked* .*" ,"*.nfo *.diz" is removed
  (you can add them to your site preferences)
- you can now kill any window from the switch window (press c in switch window,
  to get switch window press s), using this you can kill also windows that are
  lagged or busy
  
II@0.7.2.3@0 HoE EDiTiON:
---------------------------
- cursor is now hidden (if possible)
- fixed some more ncurses problems
  (the old pftp had the cursor in upper corner, i am not able to do it with
  newer ncurses...)

II@0.7.2.2@0 HoE EDiTiON:
---------------------------
- fixed bug with excluding while fxping dir
- fixed some ncurses problems
 (prolly not all of them, someone should really look why redrawwin does
  not work, coz i have no idea)

II@0.7.2.1@0 HoE EDiTiON:
---------------------------
- now works with glibc
- some small cosmetic changes
- FXP now works with dirs (FULL RECURSIVE !!!)
- fxp is set as default now
- sfv is first after directories (modified SortFileList())
 (this may change too coz its ugly)
- changed the way of excluding files during compare
 (now uses sites preferences)
- excluding preferences are changed to work with new syntax
 (these are default : "*nuked* *.diz *.nfo")
- please report problems and bugs to hoe@dle.sk
  
II@0.7.2@0 TSUNAMi EDiTiON:
---------------------------
- fixed a damn bug in FXP mode. if some file couldn't be upped or retrieved,
  pftp screwed up your whole upload. I knew I should have never put FXP
  in pftp, but oh well...
  thankx to MR_Y for telling me about it :)

II@0.7.1@0 TSUNAMi EDiTiON:
---------------------------
- sped up vital parts of pftp. while you had max. speeds of around 300kb/s
  in older versions of pftp, you now get up to 3mb/s. everything else
  dealing with TCP has a nice speed up too, eg. the process of logging in
  (thanks to zenke/EPT for pointing that out to me)
- pftp is, by the way, Y2K compliant :P

II@0.7.0@0:
-----------
- added FXP mode (files only, no whole dirs... who needs that anyways)
  (read README how to get into FXP mode)

II@0.6.2@0:
-----------
- removed timelock for all you lamerz out there

II@0.6.1@1:
-----------
- fixed segfault with some rftpd versions which reported no user + group

II@0.6.0@1:
-----------
- was a long time now, we finally got a FINAL version
- fixed MANY bugs, improved compatibility to many commond daemons,
  e.g. the 'hang' with some soft-links, some unpredictable segfaults
  and so on
- dont use this tool on sites which already banned it explicitely.


II@0.5.6@4:
-----------
- fixed a bug with stealth-mode and very large directory contents
  (stealth mode told you that a 'critical error' happened)

II@0.5.6@3:
-----------
- stealth mode added, tries to hide you from script hunters
  (read the .pftconf for more info)


II@0.5.5@1:
-----------
- fixed stalling bugs
- fixed bugs which occured sometimes after a timeout on data connection,
  where pftp was unable to re-gain control of the site


II@0.5.4@2:
-----------
- fixed minor bugs
- stalling bug seems to be fixed
- added undo-last-prepare function
- added RNDREFR
- fixed core dump on some dir-names, weirdo bug


II@0.5.3@1:
-----------
- fixed countless bugs
- util/game switch is now chained too if in FTP+ mode
- you must specify a separate dir for the .okay and .error files now (configfile)


II@0.5.0@1:
-----------
- fixed memory leak
- fixed speeding information when in log or somewhere else
- fixed support for gftpd (does not report any unix-group in filelist)
- changed behaviour in chained-mode: it caches what you do (be aware!),
  so you can start action while site is busy
- when you leech a file which you already leeched before, it's associated
  .okay (or .error) file will be wiped first [screwed uploads]
- changed command to obtain a filelist from a remote server, it now shows
  hidden files too
- speeding information is now updated if it diffs 10% to the snapshot
  before, or within 2 seconds
- remove auto-jump-to-next-field in preferences
- added quick 'O'KAY and 'C'ANCEL in preferences
- fixed cut-off in view-file
- added support for ANSI colors (strips them off)


II@0.5.0@0:	[beta I]
-----------
- read the README carefully. I rewrote all parts so you will find valuable
  information even if you are used to it. pftp II had changed in many ways,
  so take a look at it.
