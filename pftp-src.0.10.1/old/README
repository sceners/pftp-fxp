--FINAL-RELEASE-- pftp II@0.7.2@x (c) pSi --FINAL-RELEASE--

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## LEGAL CRAP (just to protect myself) #######################################
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS TOOL, WHATEVER DAMAGE IT DOES. USE AT YOUR
OWN RISK.
DON'T USE THIS SOFTWARE TO TRANSFER PIRATED SOFTWARE (AKA WAREZ). 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## THE 'THANKS FOR TELLING ME THAT' SECTION ##################################
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YOU SHOULD READ THIS CAREFULLY (AND MAYBE THE CHANGELOG FOR LATEST INFOS).
THATS NO GOOD ADVICE, IT'S A MUST! THIS TOOL ISN'T AS USERFRIENDLY AND SELF-
EXPLAINING AS IT MIGHT LOOK AT THE FIRST RUN.

I TEND TO /IGNORE PEOPLE ON IRC WHICH ASK ME ABOUT THINGS WHICH ARE COVERED
WITHIN THIS FILE.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## OVERVIEW OF pftp FEATURES #################################################
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- ftp/fxp client for unix platforms
- compatible with xftpd, bftpd, rftpd, ftp4all, eqlftpd, warftpd
- multithreaded design
- unlimited simultaneous connections / actions
- available for linux [SunOS and FreeBSD will follow for final version]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## BEFORE YOU START ##########################################################
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After unpacking the archive, you should make a directory for pftp II. Put the
supplied binary and configfile '.pftpconf' into your dir. Then have a look
at the configfile and edit it to your needs.

- the whole file isn't very userfriendly, so please JUST use the form as
  described. Otherwise unpredictable things may happen!
- comments start with a "#" as the FIRST character, the whole line will be
  ignored
- don't make empty lines, I'm not microshit where everyone can fuck up config-
  files without worrying
- items have the form "ITEMNAME=VALUE". no spaces between, nothing.

- rite now you can specify the following items:
	LINUX only:
	- DEVICE	if you are using a dialup or a machine with multiple
			network-devices, you have to use this item or you can't
			get pftp to work. You can determine what devices you
			have by issuing "ifconfig".
			ex.: "DEVICE=ppp0" or "DEVICE=eth0"

	SUN-OS only:
	- LOCALIP	some SunOS-machines seems to have problems detecting
			their own IP. You need to specify this item in case
			you have such a host (you can determine that if you
			get the error "PORT command not understood").
			It's not wrong to specify that even if your machine
			could work without it. You can JUST use a numerical
			IP here.
			ex.: "LOCALIP=123.456.234.345"

	all ports:
	- OKAYDIR	a (writable) dir where the .okay and .error files for
			transferred files are stored. Never choose a dir where
			other users could put their stuff in too, like /tmp/ !
			NEVER use a relative dir, ALWAYS absolute!
			And put a '/' on the end !
			ex.: "OKAYDIR=/home/me/pftp/okays/"

	- RNDREFR	randomizes refresh rate up to +/- half of the interval
			of each site (possible values: 0 and 1)

	- STEALTH	stealth couriering. Uses a different method to obtain
			a filelist. This one is much more reliable, faster,
			and might help to hide you from script trackers.
			(possible values: 0 and 1)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## COMMON PROBLEMS ###########################################################
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- on execution, you get an error like

	Error opening terminal: xterm.

	the problem is that the terminfo files in some distributions are
	located in directories which differ from the usual ones.
	For example if you got RedHat 5.x, they moved from /usr/lib/terminfo
	to /usr/share/terminfo.
	there are two ways to solve this, either make a symbolic link
	(if you have root access to the shell) like this (replace the first
	path with the one you have on your system):

		ln -s /usr/share/terminfo /usr/lib/terminfo

	the second way is easier because most time you will not have root
	on the box (place this in your .bash_profile or any other startfile
	of the shell you use - replace the dir with the one your system
	uses):

		export TERMINFO=/usr/share/terminfo


- pftp quits with segmentation faults all the time.
	this one is tricky, and up to now there's no solution because you
	are most likely using a glibc (libc6) system, like RedHat 5.x.
	go and install a decent distribution like RedHat4.2

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## PFTP BASICS ###############################################################
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PFTP downloads files from the source server to your shell, and uploads to all
other sites at once WHILE downloading.
This mode has two 'minor' submodes: chained and unchained. In chained-FTP mode,
all sites are kind of "chained" to each other, to "synchronize" their actual
working-dir. Means, that if you CWD on one site, all others will follow (if
possible). The PREPARE and TRANSFER functions are chained too, so all sites
should be synchronized to each other.
The unchained mode simply executes your action just on the opposite window.
In the preferences you can give sites individually the 'chained' flag. If this
flag is enabled, the corresponding site will be 'chained' to the others. If
not, it simply doesn't execute things like CWD, PREPARE and TRANSFER as a
chained site would.
Internally every site has it's own message-stack. If you make an action in the
chained-FTP mode, it posts a message to every other site saying they should do
this'n'that. So don't worry if a site is slower than others, it will still be
"synchronized" and execute all it's messages in the correct order.
If you use chained-FTP mode, take care of the working-dir of every server since
it's VERY easy to screw up a release this way.
If you need to do other work on a site while in chained-FTP mode, like looking
into different dirs and stuff, make sure you switch back to unchained mode
because all other sites would try to CD to the same dirs and so on.

(same applies to FXP mode with two exceptions: FXP can't upload one file to
more than one site at once, due to its nature. Ofcourse you can start as many
FXP uploads as you want at the same time. The 2nd thing is, you can't do
whole dirs like in FTP mode. Why? Coz I'm lazy.)

Generally you can do as many actions as you want at the same time. pftp is
multithreaded and so there's no limitation. if a site is not busy (look at the
indicators in the upper edges) then it's ready for an action.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## COMMAND LINE PARAMETERS ###################################################
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- you can omit the auto-login feature with the "-na" (no-autologin) switch.
  ex.: "pftp -na"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ALL COMMANDS ######################################
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(If you can't see colors in pftp, try setting TERM to 'linux' or whatever
appropriate. And while you are at it, think about using xwindows to get a
larger view of pftp)

## GENERAL KEYS:
----------------

- TAB-key
  use TAB to switch between the two windows (left and right) to select the
  active window which should be used for commands

- RETURN-key
  use RETURN in the site-windows to change the directory.
  alternatively you can use CURSOR-RIGHT.

- CURSOR-LEFT key
  use CURSOR-LEFT to change back from a directory to it's parent dir

- SPACE-key
  use SPACE to select/deselect dirs and files

- CURSOR-UP, CURSOR-DOWN, PAGE-UP, PAGE-DOWN
  use these keys to navigate in all windows

- ESCAPE-key
  you can cancel a dialog with ESCAPE at any time (it might take about 1/4
  second, because the keyboard-routine needs to wait if it is the beginning of
  an ESCAPE-sequence for a special key, or just plain ESCAPE).

- INSERT and DELETE (the ones above the cursor-keys)
  use these to scroll in the status-window. if a new message comes up, it will
  set you back to the end of the buffer.

- '+' and '-' (NOT the ones on the numpad)
  '+' marks all files, '-' demarks them.


## COMMAND KEYS:
----------------

- 'O'
  opens a new connection. the bookmark-manager will pop up so you can select
  a site to open, add, delete or modify. Just use TAB or CURSOR-LEFT / RIGHT
  to select the desired action with the selected site, and press RETURN.
  If you have just one connection open, then the second one will be opened in
  the opposite window so that at least all windows are filled. You can open as
  many sites as you want, there's no limitation.
  If you MODIFY or ADD a site, another dialog will pop up with the following
  items:
	ALIAS				choose a name for the site
	HOSTNAME / IP			numerical IP or DNS of the site
	USERNAME			your login name
	PASSWORD			your password for your login
	
	AFTER LOGIN CWD TO		startdir to use after login
	EXCLUDE FROM COPYING/DETECTING	filename patterns which should be
					ignored when you transfer a whole dir
					or when detecting new files.
					NFO and DIZ files are ignored by
					default, so no need to specify.
					e.g. '.BAD .MP3'
	AUTOREFRESH EVERY (SECS)	automatic filelist refresh rate
	SEND NOOP EVERY (SECS)		NOOP (no-operation) command rate
	JUMP TO NEWEST DIR/FILE		makes the cursor jump to the newest
					dir (if available) or file after you
					do a refresh (or CD into a dir)
	TRACK NEW DIRS/FILES		notices you in the status-window
					and beeps if a ne dir/file is detected.
					It caches up to 10 last visited dirs
					per site
	AUTOLOGIN ON STARTUP		logs into this site whenever you start
					pftp (omit autologin with the "-na"
					switch on startup)
	USE CHAINING ON THIS SITE	if you are in chained-FTP mode, this
					site will follow all the commands
					(it is 'chained' with the others)
	UTIL/GAMES SITE			if the site is of type util/game, you
					can define two dirs for fast changing
	SITE WHO/USER/WKUP		define the commonly used SITE commands
					(for fast access in the SITE-dialog)
					pftp automatically appends the
					username to the USER command.

  You can modify those things by pressing RETURN, and toggle with SPACE.
  Navigate in this dialog with TAB or the cursor-keys.

- 'S'
  switch a site into the actual window. If you have opened more than two sites
  (and you will), you can switch sites from the background (they remain still
  active and work like they do when you see them in a window) to front.
  A dialog will appear where you can select the site.

- 'E'
  edit the prefs of the site in the actual window. For a description of these
  preferences, see the bookmark-manager description.

- 'T'
  transfer files/dirs. When you hit 'T' while nothing is selected on the actual
  site, just the dir/file under the cursor will be copied. Otherwise all marked
  dirs and files will be transferred.
  If you have marked more files and one can't be transferred because of a dupe,
  then the copy-process will continue with the next file.
  All other errors abort the process because they are mostly unrecoverable.
  What exactly happens, depends on the mode you selected (chained, unchained).
  (and ofcourse if you are in FXP or not. FXP doesnt do whole dirs, duh. And
  it won't upload something from/to your local filesys, switch to FTP instead).

- 'K'
  transfer as OKAY. works like TRANSFER but uploads the file(s) in the form of
  "filename.ok.extension" (eg. clsab01.ok.zip).
  You can't transfer files as OKAY in chained mode, that would make no real
  sense. OKAY doesn't work when you transfer to your local-filesys too.

- 'L'
  view the log. All ftp-commands and their response from the servers are logged
  internally and can be viewed with this command (the log of the actual site
  will pop up)

- 'F'
  alternate file-list. You can view additional information about entries in the
  filelist-windows (like the user and their permissions)

- 'B'
  filelist sorting. By default, the list is sorted alphabetically. You can
  toggle alpha/chronological sorting.

- 'Y' and 'SHIFT-Y'
  cycle through the 5 newest dirs (or if no dirs, files). If you press SHIFT-Y
  you will jump back to the newest entry.

- 'C'
  close site. Logs you off the actual site. Works just when the site isn't busy.

- 'R' and 'SHIFT-R'
  refresh site(s). if you press 'r', a refresh of the actual site will be
  forced. Pressing SHIFT-R refreshes all sites at once.

- 'P' and 'SHIFT-P'
  prepare dir. Preparing a directory means the dir will be created, and the
  working dir on the source and the target (or targets in chained mode) will be
  changed to that dir. No files will be transferred yet!
  If you use just 'p' then the dir under the cursor will be created.
  When using SHIFT-P then the dir where you are in will be created (like
  you are in '/foo/buzz/bar' then you create 'bar' on the target(s))

- 'I'
  wipe last prepare. Everytime you 'p'repare a dir, you can undo this step with
  'I' afterwards, regardless in what dir you are. It CWD's back to the dir where
  it was, and tries to RMD the directory (which will obvisouly not be allowed if
  you have already uploaded files). If you are actually (NOT at the time where
  you 'p'repared the dir!) in chained mode, all sites which are chained will
  undo their last prepare. If unchained, just the actual site will execute this.

- 'Z' FTP/FXP mode selection. pro's and con's are explained at the top of this

- 'z'
  minor mode selection. switches between chained ('FTP +' / 'FXP +') and unchained
  ('FTP' / 'FXP') mode. The difference between them is explained detailed a few
  pages above.

- 'N'
  rename a file/dir. Tt will prompt you for the new name.

- 'A'
  compare filelists. The filelists of the two windows will be compared against
  each other. *.nfo, *.diz .message, .msg and *NUKE* files/dirs will be ignored.
  A ".", "-" and a "_" are equal to each other (stupid couriers tend to
  exchange these with each other). It's case in-sensitive too.
  Differences will be marked on each side, the cursor jumps to the first marked
  entry.

- 'D'
  delete file/dir. Tries to delete a file or directory. no server let's you wipe
  a directory with files/dirs in it so you will have to delete them as well if
  want to do so.

- 'M'
  make directory. Enter the name of the dir to create in the input-dialog.
  If the dir can be created, the working dir will be set to it.

- 'U' and 'G'
  change to util/game dir. If the site is a util/game site (depends on what you
  have set in its preferences), you can quick-jump to those dirs. If in chained
  mode (FTP+), pftp will switch dirs on all chained util/game sites.

- 'W'
  change working-dir. If you need to change your dir to somewhere else and it
  would take too much time walking through all dirs, simply enter the absolute
  path in the input-box and it will set the working dir to your input (if the
  server permits that).

- 'V'
  view file. Use this to view a file (the one under the cursor).

- 'X'
  SITE command. Enter your command in the input-box, and it will try to execute
  it. You can take a look on the output by viewing the log.
  Alternatively you can use the cursor-keys to select a predefined command
  (use the site's preferences to define those).

- 'Q'
  quit pftp. It logs you off all sites, regardless if they are idle.
