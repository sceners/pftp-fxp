--FINAL-RELEASE-- pftp II@0.7.2@x (c) pSi --FINAL-RELEASE--

II@0.7.2@0 TSUNAMi EDiTiON:
---------------------------
- fixed a damn bug in FXP mode. if some file couldn't be upped or retrieved,
  pftp screwed up your whole upload. I knew I should have never put FXP
  in pftp, but oh well...
  thankx to MR_Y for telling me about it :)

II@0.7.1@0 TSUNAMi EDiTiON:
---------------------------
- sped up vital parts of pftp. while you had max. speeds of around 300kb/s
  in older versions of pftp, you now get up to 3mb/s. everything else
  dealing with TCP has a nice speed up too, eg. the process of logging in
  (thanks to zenke/EPT for pointing that out to me)
- pftp is, by the way, Y2K compliant :P

II@0.7.0@0:
-----------
- added FXP mode (files only, no whole dirs... who needs that anyways)
  (read README how to get into FXP mode)

II@0.6.2@0:
-----------
- removed timelock for all you lamerz out there

II@0.6.1@1:
-----------
- fixed segfault with some rftpd versions which reported no user + group

II@0.6.0@1:
-----------
- was a long time now, we finally got a FINAL version
- fixed MANY bugs, improved compatibility to many commond daemons,
  e.g. the 'hang' with some soft-links, some unpredictable segfaults
  and so on
- dont use this tool on sites which already banned it explicitely.


II@0.5.6@4:
-----------
- fixed a bug with stealth-mode and very large directory contents
  (stealth mode told you that a 'critical error' happened)

II@0.5.6@3:
-----------
- stealth mode added, tries to hide you from script hunters
  (read the .pftconf for more info)


II@0.5.5@1:
-----------
- fixed stalling bugs
- fixed bugs which occured sometimes after a timeout on data connection,
  where pftp was unable to re-gain control of the site


II@0.5.4@2:
-----------
- fixed minor bugs
- stalling bug seems to be fixed
- added undo-last-prepare function
- added RNDREFR
- fixed core dump on some dir-names, weirdo bug


II@0.5.3@1:
-----------
- fixed countless bugs
- util/game switch is now chained too if in FTP+ mode
- you must specify a separate dir for the .okay and .error files now (configfile)


II@0.5.0@1:
-----------
- fixed memory leak
- fixed speeding information when in log or somewhere else
- fixed support for gftpd (does not report any unix-group in filelist)
- changed behaviour in chained-mode: it caches what you do (be aware!),
  so you can start action while site is busy
- when you leech a file which you already leeched before, it's associated
  .okay (or .error) file will be wiped first [screwed uploads]
- changed command to obtain a filelist from a remote server, it now shows
  hidden files too
- speeding information is now updated if it diffs 10% to the snapshot
  before, or within 2 seconds
- remove auto-jump-to-next-field in preferences
- added quick 'O'KAY and 'C'ANCEL in preferences
- fixed cut-off in view-file
- added support for ANSI colors (strips them off)


II@0.5.0@0:	[beta I]
-----------
- read the README carefully. I rewrote all parts so you will find valuable
  information even if you are used to it. pftp II had changed in many ways,
  so take a look at it.
