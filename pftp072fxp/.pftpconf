#- the whole file isn't very userfriendly, so please JUST use the form as
#  described. Otherwise unpredictable things may happen!
#- comments start with a "#" as the FIRST character, the whole line will be
#  ignored
#- don't make empty lines, I'm not microshit where eveyone can fuck up config-
#  files without worrying
#- items have the form "ITEMNAME=VALUE". no spaces between, nothing.
#
#- rite now you can specify the following items:
#        LINUX only:
#        - DEVICE        if you are using a dialup or a machine with multiple
#                        network-devices, you have to use this item or you can't
#                        get linfxp to work. You can determine what devices you
#                        have by issuing "ifcfg".
#                        ex.: "DEVICE=ppp0" "DEVICE=eth0"
#
#        SUN-OS only:
#        - LOCALIP       some SunOS-machines seems to have problems detecting
#                        their own IP. You need to specify this item in case
#                        you have such a host (you can determine that if you
#                        get the error "PORT command not understood").
#                        It's not wrong to specify that even if your machine
#                        could work without it. You can JUST use a numerical
#                        IP here.
#                        ex.: "LOCALIP=123.456.234.345"
#
#	all ports:
#	- OKAYDIR	a (writable) dir where the .okay and .error files for
#			transferred files are stored. Those are temporary
#			files needed for internal synchronization, and nothing
#			else. Dont worry about it, just wipe its contents every
#			now and then. Never choose a dir where
#			other users could put their stuff in too, like /tmp/ !
#			NEVER use a relative dir, ALWAYS absolute!
#			And put a '/' on the end !
#			ex.: "OKAYDIR=/home/me/pftp/okays/"
#
#	- RNDREFR	randomizes refresh rate up to +/- half of the interval
#			of each site (possible values: 0 and 1)
#
#	- STEALTH	stealth couriering. Uses a different method to obtain
#			a filelist.
#			WARNING: it was a nice idea, but nowadays script
#			hunters will locate pftp MORE EASYLY with this option
#			turned on! (so basically DONT USE IT, SET IT TO 0)
#			(possible values: 0 and 1)
