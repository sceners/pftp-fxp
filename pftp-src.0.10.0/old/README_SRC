again, as with linfXp back then, countless people asked for the sourcode
of pftp. since I gave up on this program quite a while ago, why not.

while looking at the source you should keep in mind that some or maybe
even many of the functions and algorithms were coded while beeing
drunk, so dont ask :)

this source will compile flawlessly on a RedHatv4.2 system, not sure
about others. it WILL NOT compile the way you want on a glibc system
(like newer RedHats). you'll get screen corruption and errors, god
knows what has changed with newer ncurses libraries.

if you plan on porting it to other platforms, keep in mind it uses
posix threads and, ofcourse, networking stuff. you won't get this
to compile without at least some changes regarding those two major
areas. you might as well need to additionally fix some keyboard input
and display output, those things aren't really standardized as one would
like it (I could at least successfully port it to fbsd and sunos).

I dont think anyone will pick up where I left pftp, and continue to
work on it (like removing bugs, annoyances or the half-working FXP
part of it). But if you do so, keep at least my copyright somewhere
next to yours then :P
